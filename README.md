The aim of the project was to create, in the functional part of a web application, a car rental management system.
It was intended to allow creation of an account, browsing rental offers, and placing orders from the perspective of normal user.
From the administrator's perspective, it included managing user accounts, car offers, and orders.
As part of the development process, a blog with comments, likes, and the ability to edit it from the website administrator's side was added.
